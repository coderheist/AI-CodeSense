# üîß Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Build is working correctly**  
‚úÖ **Configuration files updated**  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Issue: Blank screen on Vercel**

## What I've Fixed

### 1. Error Boundary Added
- Created `ErrorBoundary.jsx` to catch and display React errors
- Now you'll see error messages instead of a blank screen

### 2. Better Error Logging
- Added environment variable validation in `firebase.js`
- Added console logs to help debug in production
- Added root element check in `main.jsx`

### 3. Updated Vercel Configuration
- Fixed routing for SPA (Single Page Application)
- Added proper cache headers
- Updated build configuration

## üö® Most Likely Causes of Blank Screen

### Issue #1: Environment Variables Not Set in Vercel
**This is the #1 cause of blank screens!**

#### How to Fix:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
4. Add these EXACT variable names (Vercel is case-sensitive):

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID
VITE_API_URL
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: 
- Set them for **ALL environments** (Production, Preview, Development)
- Click "Save" after adding each one
- After adding all variables, **REDEPLOY** (don't just save)

### Issue #2: Browser Cache
Even after fixing, you might see the old blank page due to cache.

#### How to Fix:
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- Or open in Incognito/Private window
- Or clear browser cache completely

### Issue #3: Build Not Using Latest Code
The deployment might be using old code.

#### How to Fix:
1. Push all changes: `git push origin main`
2. In Vercel, go to Deployments
3. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
4. OR wait for automatic deployment from GitHub

## üîç How to Debug

### Step 1: Check Browser Console
1. Open your site: https://ai-code-sense.vercel.app/
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Go to Console tab
4. Look for errors (red text)

**Common errors to look for:**
- `Firebase: Error (auth/invalid-api-key)` ‚Üí Environment variables not set
- `Failed to fetch` ‚Üí API URL is wrong
- `Cannot read property of undefined` ‚Üí Missing environment variable
- Network errors ‚Üí Check if API is running

### Step 2: Check Network Tab
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Refresh page (F5)
4. Check if all files are loading (should be 200 status)
5. Look for failed requests (red, 404, or 500 status)

### Step 3: Check Vercel Build Logs
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to Deployments tab
4. Click on latest deployment
5. Check "Build Logs" for errors
6. Check "Runtime Logs" for runtime errors

### Step 4: Test Build Locally
```bash
# In client directory
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Then open http://localhost:4173 - if this works, the issue is Vercel-specific.

## üìù Detailed Fix Instructions

### Complete Deployment Process:

```bash
# 1. Stage all changes

## üéØ Quick Checklist

Before asking for help, verify:

- [ ] All environment variables are set in Vercel (check spelling!)

## üêõ Still Not Working?

If you've done all the above and still see a blank screen:

### Check These Specific Things:

1. **Firebase Configuration:**
   - Open browser console
   - Look for "Missing Firebase environment variables"
   - If you see this, environment variables aren't set properly in Vercel

2. **JavaScript Errors:**
   - Any error in console that stops the app from loading
   - Take a screenshot and we can debug from there

3. **Network Issues:**
   - Check if CSS and JS files are loading (Network tab)
   - If you see 404 errors, there's a routing issue

4. **Vercel Build:**
   - Check build logs for "Build failed" or warnings
   - Check if build output size is too large
